- bug: when images reach their maximum size, the div they are in (as well as
  their caption) keeps expanding.

- test original link colors
- layout slideshow
- hierarchize titles
- go through markup description and check if everything looks ok here
- implement navboxes (currently deactivated)
- design the geography infobox properly

- have some way to access the menu, edit buttons etc.

- jump back to the right anchor after css has loaded (we should find a way to
  prevent loading the first css anyway)

- be more precise with infoboxes

- hilight reference when clicked

- use x2 for centered images too?
