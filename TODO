- find a better visited link color
- fix & layout slideshow
- hierarchize titles
- go through markup description and check if everything looks ok here
- have some way to access the menu and edit, talk etc. links
- Deactivate on talk, special and user pages?
- get the switch to work

- ULs can't all be 30em wide, bc some are in mboxes for ex

Later:

- clean up and organize all the css
- implement navboxes? not sure if really needed - there could be a checkbox
- more precise infoboxes
- deal with multi thumbnails
- find a better name and logo
- more precise permissions
