- test original link colors
- layout slideshow
- hierarchize titles
- go through markup description and check if everything looks ok here
- implement navboxes (currently deactivated)
- design the geography infobox properly

- have some way to access the menu, edit buttons etc.

- jump back to the right anchor after css has loaded (we should find a way to
  prevent loading the first css anyway)
